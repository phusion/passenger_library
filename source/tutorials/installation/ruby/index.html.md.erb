# Installation
<%= render_partial('/shared/current_selection', locals: { disabled_selections: [:integration] }) %>

Installing Passenger is easy. During development, you use Bundler to install Passenger.

Open your application's Gemfile and add "passenger":

~~~ruby
gem "passenger", ">= <%= MIN_RECOMMENDED_PASSENGER_VERSION %>", require: "phusion_passenger/rack_handler"
~~~

Now open a terminal, go to your application's directory and run bundle install to install your gem bundle:

<pre class="highlight">
<span class="prompt">$ </span>cd /path-to-your-app
<span class="prompt">$ </span>bundle install
<span class="output">...
Installing passenger x.x.x
...
Your bundle is complete!</span>
</pre>

You can verify that it works by querying Passenger's version number:

<pre class="highlight"><span class="prompt">$ </span>bundle exec passenger --version
<span class="output">Phusion Passenger version X.X.X

"Phusion Passenger" is a trademark of Hongli Lai &amp; Ninh Bui.</span></pre>

<div class="note">Installation in production is different, but we'll cover that later in the <a href="../../deploy/ruby/">deployment tutorial</a>.</div>
