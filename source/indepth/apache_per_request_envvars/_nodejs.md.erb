### Secure HTTP header: `!~Passenger-Envvars`

Since version 5.0.21, per-request environment variables can be accessed through the [secure HTTP header](/config/apache/secure_http_headers/nodejs/index.html) named `!~Passenger-Envvars`. This header contains an encoded dump of per-request environment variables.

The encoding is in the following format:

    base64("key1\0value1\0key2\0value2\0")

In other words, all keys and values are appended into a single string, with NULL separators. The entire result is then base64'ed.

Suppose that your site is using SSL, and that you that `SSLOptions StdEnvVars` enabled. You can access the `SSL_SESSION_ID` environment variable as follows:

~~~javascript
function parseEnvvarDump(dump) {
    var ary = dump.split("\0");
    var result = {};
    var i;

    for (i = 0; i < ary.length - 1; i += 2) {
        result[ary[i]] = ary[i + 1];
    }

    return result;
}

var envvarB64 = req.headers['!~passenger-envvars'];
var envvarDump = new Buffer(envvarB64, 'base64').toString('binary');
var env = parseEnvvarDump(envvarDump);

console.log(env.SSL_SESSION_ID);   // Prints some session ID value
~~~

### The `process.env` object

When Passenger handles a request and decides to spawn a new application process, Passenger will store the values of any per-request environment variables into OS-level environment variables. This is only done once per application process, and only when the application process is spawned.

This is primarily useful for ensuring that the `SetEnv` directive works as expected. For example, suppose that you have this in your Apache configuration file:

~~~apache
SetEnv APP_NAME mydemoapp
~~~

You can then access `APP_NAME` using `process.env`, which is a mechanism in <%= language_runtime_name %> for accessing OS-level environment variables:

~~~javascript
console.log(process.env.APP_NAME);   // Prints: mydemoapp
~~~

There are two important caveats to be aware of:

 1. `process.env` does not change, so it must not be used for accessing per-request environment variables whose values may change on a per-request basis. For example, do not call `process.env.SSL_SESSION_ID` because `SSL_SESSION_ID` changes on a per-client basis.
 2. If Passenger spawns an application process, but not as part of handling a request, then that application process will not have per-request environment variables stored inside OS-level environment variables.
