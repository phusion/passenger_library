<% if language_default_concurrency == 1 && language_max_concurrency == 0 %>
  For <%= language_name %> applications, the maximum process concurrency is assumed to be 1. This means that Passenger assumes each process can handle 1 request at a time.

  This can be changed by setting <%= link_to_config_option(:concurrency_model, locals) %> to `thread`, and by setting <%= link_to_config_option(:thread_count, locals) %>. If you do that, the assumed maximum process concurrency will equal the number of configured threads. This reflects the fact that each thread can handle 1 request at a time.
<% elsif language_default_concurrency == 1 && language_max_concurrency == 1 %>
  For <%= language_name %> applications, the maximum process concurrency is always 1.
<% elsif language_default_concurrency == 0 %>
  For <%= language_name %> applications, the maximum process concurrency is assumed to be *unlimited*. This is because <%= language_runtime_name %> uses <%= language_concurrency_model_name_plural %> for concurrency which is very lightweight, so it can handle a virtually unlimited number of requests concurrently.

  <% if language_concurrency_model == :evented %>
  Having said that, as a <%= language_runtime_name %> process handles more concurrent requests, it is normal for performance to degrade. The practical concurrency is not really unlimited, and the limit varies for every application and every workload.
