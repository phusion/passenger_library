# Passenger YUM repository (.rpm packages)
<%= render_partial('/shared/current_selection', locals: { disabled_selections: [:lang] }) %>

We provide YUM/RPM repositories for installing Passenger on Enterprise Linux (Red Hat, CentOS, Rocky, Alma) systems. There are separate repositories for the open source and Enterprise versions.

<% if integration_mode_type == :nginx %>
  If you use these packages to install Passenger then you do not need to run `passenger-install-nginx-module`. These packages contain all the binaries that you need, including a Passenger-enabled Nginx binary. These packages also come with SELinux policy modules so that Passenger works nicely with SELinux.
<% elsif integration_mode_type == :apache %>
  If you use these packages to install Passenger then you do not need to run `passenger-install-apache2-module`. These packages contain all the binaries that you need. These packages also come with SELinux policy modules so that Passenger works nicely with SELinux.

    Our YUM repository may not be used with Amazon Linux. Amazon Linux is too different from Enterprise Linux. If you are on Amazon Linux, you should use the <%= link_to "generic installation method through tarball or RubyGems", "/advanced_guides/install_and_upgrade/nginx/install/index.html" %>.

## Background information and release policy

### Always up-to-date

Our packages are automatically built by our build server after we push out a source release, and thus are always up to date with the official source releases.

### Limited architectures

Packages are available for the x86_64 architecture only.

### Supported distribution versions

Our policy is to support all Enterprise Linux (Red Hat, CentOS, Rocky, Alma) releases that still receive full updates by their vendors. The earliest Enterprise Linux version we support is version 7.
