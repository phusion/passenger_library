# Migrating from Passenger 4 to 5 (<%= integration_mode_name %> version)

Passenger 5 comes with [many major improvements](https://blog.phusion.nl/2015/03/04/phusion-passenger-5-0-1-released) and is mostly compatible with Passenger 4. This section highlights important and incompatible changes.

## APT repository changed to 5.0

Our main APT repository switched to Passenger 5. If there is a pressing need to remain on Passenger 4, use the legacy [Passenger 4 APT repository](https://blog.phusion.nl/2015/03/08/passenger-4-apt-repository-now-available/).

<% if integration_mode_type == :apache || integration_mode_type == :nginx %>
## Full web server restart required

To avoid a broken st.ate where half of Passenger 4 is running and half of Passenger 5, you must **fully restart** the web server after upgrading to Passenger 5.

<% if integration_mode_type == :apache %>
This means executing `apachectl stop` and `apachectl start`. An `apachectl reload` or even `apachectl restart` is *not enough*.
<% end %>

If you upgraded using APT, you must invoke the web server restart manually. APT does not do this for you!
<% end %>

## Minimum Rails version: 2.3

We've dropped support for Rails version older than 2.3.

To make Rails 2.3 apps work with Passenger 5, the app must have a `config.ru` file. For example:

~~~ruby
# Require your environment file to bootstrap Rails
require ::File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/config/environment'

# Serve static assets from RAILS_ROOT/public directory
# use Rails::Rack::Static
# Dispatch the request
run ActionController::Dispatcher.new
~~~

## Restart mechanism changed

Using `restart.txt` to restart the app is still supported, but with the new default settings, Passenger won't notice any changes until after max 10 seconds. We [recommend](https://blog.phusion.nl/2015/03/04/whats-new-in-passenger-5-part-2-better-logging-better-restarting-better-websockets-and-more/#improvedapplicationrestartingmechanism) using the `passenger-config restart-app` command.

If you want to revert to the old restart.txt behavior (where any change is noticed immediately on the next request), set
<% if integration_mode_type == :apache -%>
  [PassengerStatThrottleRate](<%= url_for '/config/apache/reference/index.html' %>#passengerstatthrottlerate)
<% elsif integration_mode_type == :nginx || integration_mode_type == :standalone -%>
  [passenger_stat_throttle_rate](<%= url_for '/config/nginx/reference/index.html' %>#passenger_stat_throttle_rate) (using [the Nginx configuration template](<%= url_for '/config/standalone/intro.html' %>#nginx-configuration-template))
<% else -%>
  <% raise 'Unknown integration mode' %>
<% end -%>
to 0.

## Feature and configuration changes

 * If you use out-of-band garbage collection, beware that the `X-Passenger-Request-OOB-Work` header has now been renamed to `!~Request-OOB-Work`.
 * When using Rack's full socket hijacking, you must now output an HTTP status line.
<% if integration_mode_type == :nginx %>
 * The minimum required Nginx version is now 1.6.0.
 * The `passenger_set_cgi_param` option has been removed and replaced by [passenger_set_header](<%= url_for '/config/nginx/reference/index.html' %>#passenger_set_header) and [passenger_env_var](<%= url_for '/config/nginx/reference/index.html' %>#passenger_env_var).
 * [passenger_show_version_in_header](<%= url_for '/config/nginx/reference/index.html' %>#passenger_show_version_in_header) is now only valid in the `http` context.
 * The [passenger_enabled on](<%= url_for '/config/nginx/reference/index.html' %>#passenger_enabled) directive is now inherited across location blocks. This wasn't the case previously, so you had to re-specify it inside location blocks. Now the opposite holds: if you specified `passenger_enabled on` in the server block, then you have to explicitly specify `passenger_enabled off` in all location blocks where you disabled Passenger.
 * The `passenger_temp_dir` option has been replaced by two config options: [passenger_instance_registry_dir](<%= url_for '/config/nginx/reference/index.html' %>#passenger_instance_registry_dir) and [passenger_data_buffer_dir](<%= url_for '/config/nginx/reference/index.html' %>#passenger_data_buffer_dir).
<% end %>
<% if integration_mode_type == :apache %>
 * The [PassengerStatThrottleRate](<%= url_for '/config/apache/reference/index.html' %>#passengerstatthrottlerate) option is now global.
 * The `PassengerTempDir` option has been replaced by two config options: [PassengerInstanceRegistryDir](<%= url_for '/config/apache/reference/index.html' %>#passengerinstanceregistrydir) and [PassengerDataBufferDir](<%= url_for '/config/apache/reference/index.html' %>#passengerdatabufferdir).
 * The `PassengerUploadBufferDir` option has been replaced by [PassengerDataBufferDir](<%= url_for '/config/apache/reference/index.html' %>#passengerdatabufferdir).
<% end %>
<% if integration_mode_type == :standalone %>
 * The [Nginx configuration template](<%= url_for '/config/standalone/intro.html' %>#nginx-configuration-template) has changed. Users are encouraged to update it.
 * `passenger-standalone.json` has been renamed to `Passengerfile.json`.
 * `passenger-standalone.json`/`Passengerfile.json` no longer overrides command line options. Instead, command line options now have the highest priority.
