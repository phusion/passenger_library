<%= h2(id_prefix, "#{header_step} Configuring Nginx and Passenger") %>

Now that you are done with transferring your app's code to the server and setting up an environment for your app, it is time to configure Nginx so that Passenger knows how to serve your app.

<% if language_type == :ruby %>
  <% substep += 1 %>
  <% determine_ruby_substep = substep %>
  <%= h3(id_prefix, "#{header_step}.#{substep} Determine the Ruby command that Passenger should use") %>

  <p>
    We need to tell Passenger which Ruby command it should use to run your app, just in case there are multiple Ruby interpreters on your system. Please run <code>passenger-config about ruby-command</code> to find out which Ruby interpreter you are using. For example:
  </p>
  <pre class="highlight"><span class="prompt">$ </span><%= passenger_command_prefix(locals) %>passenger-config about ruby-command
<span class="output">passenger-config was invoked through the following Ruby interpreter:
  Command: /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-<%= LATEST_RUBY_VERSION %>/wrappers/ruby
  Version: ruby <%= LATEST_RUBY_VERSION %>p85 (2015-02-26 revision 49769) [x86_64-linux]
  ...</span></pre>

  Please take note of the path after "Command" (in this example, `/usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-<%= LATEST_RUBY_VERSION %>/wrappers/ruby`). You will need it in one of the next steps.

<% if needs_login_as_app_user_to_prepare_environment?(locals) %>
<% substep += 1 %>
<%= h3(id_prefix, "#{header_step}.#{substep} Go back to the admin account") %>

You have previously logged into your app's user account in order to prepare the app's environment. That user does not have sudo access. In the next steps, you need to edit configuration files, for which sudo access is needed. So you need to switch back to the admin account.

This can be done by simply exiting the shell that was logged into the app's user account. You will then be dropped back to the admin account. For example:

<pre class="highlight"><span class="c"># This is what you previously ran:</span>
<span class="output">admin$ sudo -u myappuser -H bash -l
myappuser$ ...</span>

<span class="c"># Type `exit` to go back to the account you were before</span>
<span class="prompt">myappuser$ </span>exit
<span class="prompt">admin$</span> _</pre>

    We need to edit your Nginx configuration file and setup a virtual host entry that points to your app. This virtual host entry tells Nginx (and Passenger) where your app is located.
  </p>
  <p>
    The location of the Nginx configuration file depends on <a href="/advanced_guides/install_and_upgrade/nginx/install/index.html#using_nginx">the Nginx installation prefix you chose while installing Passenger</a>. Assuming you installed Nginx to the default prefix <code>/opt/nginx</code>, you need to open /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf:
  </p>
  <pre class="highlight"><span class="prompt">$ </span>sudo nano /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf</pre>
  <p>
    Let us add a virtual host entry at the end of that file. At the end of the file, insert:

  Replace `yourserver.com` with your server's host name, and replace `/var/www/myapp/code` with your application's code directory path. However, make sure that Nginx is configured to point to the `public` subdirectory inside it!

  Replace `/path-to-ruby` with the Ruby command that you obtained in [step <%= header_step %>.<%= determine_ruby_substep %>](#<%= id_prefix %>determine-the-ruby-command-that-passenger-should-use).

   Replace `yourserver.com` with your server's host name, replace `passenger_wsgi.py` with your app's WSGI entry point file and replace `/var/www/myapp/code` with your application's code directory path. However, make sure that Nginx is configured to point to the `public` subdirectory inside it!

   Replace `/path-to-python` with the location of the Python executable for the version with which the app was built. This is likely to be the folder containing the virtual environment.

  Replace `yourserver.com` with your server's host name and replace `/var/www/myapp/bundle` with your application's package directory path. Replace `myappdb` with an appropriate MongoDB database name. Also be sure to set `ROOT_URL` to an appropriate value.

  <div class="info">
    In some cases you will have to change the location directory instead of using the public directory. For example, if you are using Webpack, Nginx will not serve the built bundle because it is not in the <code>public</code> folder. You need to add the <code>location</code> setting to the server block:

<pre><code>server {
  ...
  <span class="c"># Tell Nginx where Webpack puts the build output</span>
  location /static/ {
    autoindex on;
    alias /var/www/appname/appname/buildoutput/;
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre>
  </div>

  Replace `yourserver.com` with your server's host name, and replace `/var/www/myapp/code` with your application's code directory path. However, make sure that Nginx is configured to point to the `public` subdirectory inside it!

  <div></div>
<% end %>

When you are done, restart Nginx:

<div class="supported_debian_instructions supported_redhat_instructions">
  <pre class="highlight"><span class="prompt">$ </span>sudo service nginx restart</pre>
</div>
<div class="unsupported_debian_instructions unsupported_redhat_instructions">
  <pre class="highlight"><span class="prompt">$ </span>sudo <span class="nb">kill</span> <span class="k">$(</span>cat /opt/nginx/logs/nginx.pid<span class="k">)</span>
<span class="prompt">$ </span>sudo /opt/nginx/sbin/nginx</pre>

</div>

<% substep += 1 %>
<%= h3(id_prefix, "#{header_step}.#{substep} Test drive") %>

You should now be able to access your app through the server's host name! Try running this from your local computer. Replace `yourserver.com` with your server's hostname, exactly as it appears in the Nginx config file's `server_name` directive.

<pre class="highlight"><span class="prompt">$ </span>curl http://yourserver.com/
<span class="output">...your app's front page HTML...</span></pre>

If you do not see your app's front page HTML, then these are the most likely causes:

1. You did not correctly configure your `server_name` directive. The `server_name` must exactly match the host name in the URL. For example, if you use the command `curl http://45.55.91.235/` to access your app, then the `server_name` must be `45.55.91.235`.
2. You did not setup DNS records. Setting up DNS is outside the scope of this tutorial. In the mean time, we recommend that you use your server's IP address as the server name.
